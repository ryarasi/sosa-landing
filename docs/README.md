# SOSA Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Society of Societal Architects (SOSA) landing page and platform. This documentation provides detailed implementation guides, design principles, and technical specifications for building a decentralized think tank platform.

## üìö Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation

1. **[Design System](./design-system.md)** - Network State design aesthetics and visual guidelines
2. **[Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture.md)** - Google Forms + Discord integration details
3. **[Globe Visualization](./globe-visualization.md)** - D3.js/React-globe.gl implementation guide
4. **[Messaging Strategy](./messaging-strategy.md)** - Copywriting patterns and trust-building approaches
5. **[Conversion Optimization](./conversion-optimization.md)** - Waitlist and CTA optimization strategies
6. **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)** - Step-by-step guide to building the landing page

## üéØ Mission Statement

SOSA pioneers incorruptible research through decentralized governance, creating trustworthy policy recommendations through collective intelligence and algorithmic transparency.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Review the [Design System](./design-system.md) to understand the visual language
2. Check the [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md) for step-by-step guidance
3. Set up the technical infrastructure using the [Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture.md) guide
4. Implement the interactive elements following the [Globe Visualization](./globe-visualization.md) documentation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The SOSA platform combines several key technologies:

- **Frontend**: Modern web technologies with dark mode aesthetics
- **Backend**: Google Apps Script + Make (Integromat) for email workflows
- **Visualization**: React-globe.gl for interactive network metaphors
- **Community**: Discord integration for verified member access
- **Analytics**: Privacy-respecting metrics for conversion optimization

## üìã Core Principles

### Independence
No single sponsor or interest group can influence our research. Decisions are made collectively through transparent governance mechanisms.

### Transparency
All research methodologies, funding sources, and decision processes are publicly accessible. Our algorithms and data are open for scrutiny.

### Impact
We focus on research that creates measurable societal benefit. Every project must demonstrate clear pathways to positive real-world outcomes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Design**: Dark mode (#0A0A0A) with accent color (#00D4FF)
- **Typography**: Inter font family with dramatic size hierarchy
- **Visualization**: WebGL/Three.js through React-globe.gl
- **Forms**: Google Forms with custom styling
- **Automation**: Google Apps Script + Make webhooks
- **Hosting**: Static site with serverless functions

## üìä Performance Targets

- Page load: < 3 seconds
- Time to Interactive: < 5 seconds
- Mobile-first responsive design
- 60fps animations on globe visualization
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## ü§ù Contributing

This documentation is part of the SOSA initiative to create transparent, incorruptible research infrastructure. Contributions should align with our core principles of independence, transparency, and impact.

## üìù License

The SOSA project operates under principles of open governance and transparent operations. Specific licensing details are available in the project repository.
