```
We are independent because [specific mechanism], 
not despite [common weakness].
```

Example:
> "We are independent because our funding is algorithmically distributed across thousands of contributors, not despite having donors."

### Transparency Signals

**Funding Transparency:**
> "Every funding source is recorded on-chain. No hidden donors, no secret agendas."

**Methodology Transparency:**
> "Our research methods are open-source. Verify our work, replicate our findings."

**Governance Transparency:**
> "All decisions are made through transparent voting. See how we decide in real-time."

## üìä Conversion-Focused Copy

### CTA Button Copy

**Primary CTAs:**
- "Request Early Access" (exclusivity + action)
- "Join the Movement" (community + purpose)
- "Claim Your Spot" (ownership + urgency)
- "Start Your Journey" (personal + beginning)

**Secondary CTAs:**
- "See How It Works" (education)
- "Explore Our Research" (value preview)
